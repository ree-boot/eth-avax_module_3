# Avalanche_module_3
This Solidity program is a simple contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language and the working of smart contracts in a blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for a future Web3 and blockchain Journey.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has simple functionality that demonstrates the creation and use of custom tokens in Solidity. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension and copy the code present in this file to new one.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile program.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "program" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the functions and passing appropriate values.
